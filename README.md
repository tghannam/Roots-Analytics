## Welcome to Roots Analytics, where data science meets innovation.

# Project 1:
## Analyze The Randomness Of Data Generated From A Random Number Generator Using Various Statistical Techniques
* 1 - Subjected data to multiple statistical analysis tools:
*   a- Chi square (CS) test
*   b- Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test
*   c- Anderson-Darling (AD) test
* 2- Statistical tests were written in Python from basic principles.
* 3- Ran tests on multiple configurations of the data:
*   a- Investigated frequency of all connected pairs of 8-bit segments (e.g., a 64-bit number has 7 pairs of 8-bit segments).
*   b- Two methods used:
*    - Look at all test pairs together to check general distribution.
*    - Split pairs based on the first segment and analyze each separately to check for conditional probability.
* 4- Data was collected from the random number generator, cleaned, and organized into ordered Excel sheets with specific names and hierarchies.
* 5- Results were illustrated using various plots and presented through a professional BI dashboard.
* 6- Dashboard created using the Plotly Dash library and deployed online via the Heroku platform.
